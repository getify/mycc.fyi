# MyCC.FYI

This is a simple static HTML/CSS only site (no JS, no server, etc) built for one purpose: to let you *trick* your browser (Chrome, etc) into autofilling your own saved CC details into a `<form>` that looks like an ecommerce check-out form, so you can see the stored number, expiration, and (if applicable) CVV code.

That your data, and you chose to securely store it in your browser/payment manager. This tool just makes it easier for you to see your own data.

There is ABSOLUTELY NO TRACKING OR SPYING CODE whatsoever on this page. You *could* just run it locally in your own browser, but I think browsers are more reluctant to autofill sensitive info when you do so. That's the only reason this is a real site.

But it's hosted here on Github-Pages so that you know it's not on some suspicious private server with potentially nefarious tracking going on, and so that you can see all the "code" (again, HTML/CSS only) that's on it.
