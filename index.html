<h1>Credit Card Autofill Viewer</h1>
<details>
  <summary>What is this?</summary>
  <p>This is a simple static HTML/CSS only site (no JS, no server, etc) built for one purpose: to let you trick your browser (Chrome, etc) into autofilling your own saved CC details into a <form> that looks like an ecommerce check-out form, so you can see the stored number, expiration, and (if applicable) CVV code.</p>
  <p>That's your data, and you chose to securely store it in your browser/payment manager. This tool just makes it easier for you to see your own data.</p>
  <p>There is ABSOLUTELY NO TRACKING OR SPYING CODE whatsoever on this page. You could just run it locally in your own browser, but I think browsers are more reluctant to autofill sensitive info when you do so. That's the only reason this is a real site.</p>
  <p>But it's <a href="https://github.com/getify/mycc.fyi">hosted here on Github-Pages</a> so that you know it's not on some suspicious private server with potentially nefarious tracking going on, and so that you can see all the "code" (again, HTML/CSS only) that's on it.</p>
